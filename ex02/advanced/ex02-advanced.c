// TEST(x) is called a preprocessor macro.
// It looks like a procedure call.  It acts like one EXCEPT
// that it is invoked at preprocess time, before compilation.
// The argument(s) is a string.  Whatever is passed as the arg
// takes its place when expanding the symbol TEST in the
// C program.  Here the arguments name is x.  #x means "put quotes
// around whatever string was passed as x."  In C you can
// concatenate literal strings just by putting them next to each other.
// So, "one two" and "one " "two" are the same literal.

  // (2) most importantly, so there'd be one "definition" of the test call so
  //     thatif I want to change it later I go to one place (the #define above)
  //     rather than having to change it in 5 distinct statements, which is
  //     more error prone
