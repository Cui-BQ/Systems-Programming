Feedback:
word-pair-frequency.cc | [significant] | Read in pairs of words rather than a
  single word. This means that you end up missing pairs of words. For example,
  with the sentence "the cat jumped high", the pairs in this program are
  (the, cat), (cat, jumped), (jumped, high). Your program will consider only the
  pairs (the, cat) and (jumped, high).
