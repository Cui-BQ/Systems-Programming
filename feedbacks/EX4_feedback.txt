my_memmove.c | [Significant] | Wrong implementation of memmove. | If dest's address is greater than src's address and both memory chunks are overlapping, your memmove will produce wrong result.
my_memmove.c | [Significant] | Lacking 1 or 2 README file components. | No timing result in README.
my_memmove.c | [Significant] | No comments.
