HW2 Feedback


Test Suite: 305/305


Valgrind: 0/5
(-5) Substantial valgrind errors (above 48 bytes and 2 contexts).

Modularity: 4/5
(-1) Re-implemented the functionality of DocTable_GetDocID instead of calling it in DocTable_Add. DocTable.c:68

Blending with starter code: 5/5


Robustness and error checking: 4/5
(-1) Doesn't check EAGAIN or EINTR properly to continue reading. FileParser.c:111

Comments and other style issues: 4/5
(-1) Compiler warning.

Search shell: 2/5
[Min scored capped at 2/5 if queries work correctly]
(-3) At least 1 input causes segfault or Verify333 to fail
(-2) Incorrect documents or document ranking listed
(-1) searchshell does not exit gracefully upon EOF or Ctrl+D.
(-0) fgets should be called in a loop just like you would call read. Since there is no guarentee for the length of the query, you can just realloc to create more space in your buffer.

Bonus: 0/5
